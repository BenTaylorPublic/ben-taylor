<div id="coldsteel">
    Coldsteel is a game engine/framework/wrapper I wrote. It's dynamic in the sense that you can use it for things
    other than games. It's written in C++, and wraps <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a>. Coldsteel currently
    works on macOS and Windows. I'm currently working on documentation, and once that's finished, it'll be on github
    (and I'll provide a link here).
