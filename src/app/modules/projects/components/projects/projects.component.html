                OneFunction is a naked HTML + CSS + JS program I wrote that is all in one function, which loops

                IPOC is a C++ game engine/framework/tool I've been working on.
                It wraps SFML, and is currently not on Github yet.
                It's going to be rewritten with Vulkan, and renamed to Coldsteel.
